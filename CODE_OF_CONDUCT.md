# What is forbidden
- Anything that's not **directly** related to this project. This includes discussing about what one contributor said on any other platform. If it doesn't directly affect the code, it's irrelevant and any disscusion about it is not helping the project, it can possibly even hurt it.
- Lying and general missinformation. This means spreading false information on purpose, like telling someone a feature is implemented, while in reality it's not even planned. Telling something that you *think* is true when it is not doesn't count if you admin to being wrong and correct your mistake. We're all humans and we all make mistakes, just don't make them on purpose.
- Directly attacking another contributor or a member of the community, especially in commit messages and pull requests, but also in issues. If there is any disagreement, settle it down on your own, on any other platform that's more suited for talking, like discord or slack. It doesn't matter wheter the attack is because of race, religion sexuality or whether to use tabs or spaces, they will all cause the attacking person to be permamently banned from this project. By "ban" I mean: All your issues will be ignored and closed immediately and all your pull request will be rejected without even looking at the code.
- Opinions about this project that have no meaningfull feadback. If you love this project, give it a star. If you don't, open an issue and write what exactly you don't like and what could be done about it. Issues that just say how good or bad this project is will be closed.
