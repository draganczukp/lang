# Code standards used in the project:
## Indent with tabs.
## Curly brace opens on the same line as the statement, but closes on it's own line. Exceptions: one line methods and lambdas
## Spaces between arithmetic operators, no space before and after opening brace. No space before closing brace, but one space between closing brace and opening curly brace.
## No limit on line width, just keep it sane. You don't have to break after 80 characters, but 200 characters line is unreadabe
## Don't depend on extarnal libraries. The language for parser/compiler may (and most likely will) change, so these libraries will only slow everything down
