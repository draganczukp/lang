# An unnamed language

I decided to make my own programming language ~~With Black Jack. And hookers~~

The current interpreter is written in Java. I'm planning on making an actual compiler, with possible rewrite in this language in the far future.

### Why?
Why not? I combined some features I liked in other languages and added some of the things I wanted to see in them.

## Why is it called "An unnamed language"?
The reason is very simple: I'm not creative and I'm bad at naming things. I'm open for suggestions.

## Feature/TODO list
- [ ] Parser
	- [x] Load the code from a file
	- [ ] Split the code into commands --> *Working on this...*
	- [ ] Make a different type of command depending on whether it's a loop, a function etc. --> *..and this*
	- [ ] Execute each command, from top to bottom --> *Kind of done, but it's just a test command that prints "Hello world"*
- [ ] Built in functions
	- [ ] print, println
	- [ ] read
	- [ ] math stuff (sin, cos, power, square root etc.)
	- [ ] typeof
- [ ] Structure
	- [ ] Classes
	- [ ] Namespaces, imports
	- [ ] Functions
	- [ ] Variables
	- [ ] Loops
	- [ ] If statements, switch/case
